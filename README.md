## Overview of the UFO Project
This project was created to display data related to UFO sightings on a website where this data can be displayed. The website allows a user to input information to search about the date of a sighting, city, state, or country of a sighting or the shape of the sighting. The website draws from information contained in a java script file about UFO sightings.
